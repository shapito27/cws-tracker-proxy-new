# CWS Tracker Proxy - Cloudflare Worker

Cloudflare Worker that proxies Chrome Web Store requests for the CWS Tracker extension.

Chrome blocks extensions from accessing CWS domains directly (CORS, content script injection, scripting API all restricted). This proxy fetches CWS pages server-side and returns content to the extension.

## Deploy your own (one click) — recommended

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/shapito27/cws-tracker-proxy)

Click the button to deploy this proxy to **your own** Cloudflare account on the free tier (100,000 requests/day — far more than the extension needs). No CLI required.

1. **Click the button** and authorize Cloudflare. It clones this repo into your GitHub and creates a Worker in your account.
2. **Set your API key** when prompted for `API_KEYS`. This is a shared secret you invent — use any long random string (e.g. run `openssl rand -hex 32`). Save it; you'll paste it into the extension.
3. **Wait for the deploy to finish**, then copy your Worker URL — it looks like `https://cws-tracker-proxy.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.
4. **Configure the extension** → open **Settings** and paste:
   - **Proxy URL** = your Worker URL
   - **Proxy API Key** = the same `API_KEYS` value from step 2
5. **Run a scan** — rankings should come back through your own proxy.

Pushes to your cloned repo auto-redeploy. Prefer to do it by hand? See **Manual deployment** below.

---

## Prerequisites

- A **Cloudflare account** (free plan is sufficient)
- **Node.js** 18+ installed locally
- **npm** installed

---

## Manual deployment (advanced)

Prefer the CLI over the one-click button above? Follow these steps.

### Step 1: Create a Cloudflare Account

1. Go to [https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
2. Sign up with email and password
3. No domain or credit card is required for Workers free tier

**Free tier limits:**
- 100,000 requests per day
- 10ms CPU time per request
- Unlimited Workers

This is more than enough for the CWS Tracker extension.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd proxy
npm install
```

This installs:
- **wrangler** - Cloudflare's CLI tool for developing, testing, and deploying Workers
- **@cloudflare/workers-types** - TypeScript types for the Workers runtime
- **vitest** + **@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers** - Testing framework

### Step 3: Authenticate Wrangler with Cloudflare

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

This opens your browser and asks you to authorize Wrangler to access your Cloudflare account. Click **Allow**.

After authorization, Wrangler stores a token locally at `~/.wrangler/config/default.toml`. You won't need to login again on this machine.

To verify it worked:

```bash
npx wrangler whoami
```

This should print your Cloudflare account name and ID.

### Step 4: Generate Your API Key

The proxy requires an API key to prevent unauthorized use. **You create this key yourself** - it's not provided by Cloudflare. It's a shared secret between your extension and your proxy.

Generate a random key:

```bash
# Option A: Using openssl
openssl rand -hex 32

# Option B: Using Node.js
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Option C: Using Python
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

This produces something like:
```
a3f8b2c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1
```

**Save this key.** You'll need it in two places:
1. As a secret in Cloudflare Workers (Step 5)
2. In the extension's settings as the proxy API key (later)

### Step 5: Set the API Keys Secret

Secrets are encrypted environment variables that your Worker can read but that never appear in your code or dashboard in plain text.

```bash
npx wrangler secret put API_KEYS
```

When prompted, paste your API key and press Enter. If you want multiple keys (e.g., one for development, one for production), separate them with commas:

```
a3f8b2c4d5e6f7...key1,b4c9d0e1f2a3...key2
```

### Step 6: Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Wrangler will:
1. Bundle your TypeScript code
2. Upload it to Cloudflare's edge network
3. Print the URL of your deployed Worker

Output looks like:
```
Published cws-tracker-proxy (X.XX sec)
  https://cws-tracker-proxy.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev
```

**Save this URL.** This is your proxy endpoint.

### Step 7: Verify Deployment

Test the health endpoint (no auth needed):

```bash
curl https://cws-tracker-proxy.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2026-02-05T...","version":"0.1.0"}
```

Test fetching an extension (auth required):

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  "https://cws-tracker-proxy.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/detail?id=cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm"
```

Expected: JSON response with `html` field containing the CWS page HTML.

## Local Development

### Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts a local dev server at `http://localhost:8787`. For local dev, copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` and set your key there — `.dev.vars` is gitignored, so it never gets committed:

```
# .dev.vars
API_KEYS=dev-test-key
```

Wrangler loads `.dev.vars` automatically in `npm run dev`. For production the key is a Worker secret (`npx wrangler secret put API_KEYS`) or is entered during the one-click deploy — never put it in `wrangler.toml`.

### Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

22 tests covering auth, CORS, validation, routing, and error handling.

### Test locally with curl

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8787/health

# Fetch extension detail
curl -H "X-API-Key: dev-test-key" \
  "http://localhost:8787/detail?id=cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm"

# Fetch search results
curl -H "X-API-Key: dev-test-key" \
  "http://localhost:8787/search?q=ad+blocker"

# Fetch with locale
curl -H "X-API-Key: dev-test-key" \
  "http://localhost:8787/detail?id=cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm&hl=ja"
```

## How it Works

```
Extension                    Cloudflare Worker              Chrome Web Store
   |                              |                              |
   |  GET /detail?id=xxx&key=yyy  |                              |
   |----------------------------->|                              |
   |                              |  GET /detail/xxx?hl=en       |
   |                              |----------------------------->|
   |                              |                              |
   |                              |  200 OK (HTML page)          |
   |                              |<-----------------------------|
   |                              |                              |
   |  200 OK { html: "..." }      |                              |
   |<-----------------------------|                              |
```

1. Extension sends request to proxy with API key
2. Proxy validates API key and checks rate limits
3. Proxy fetches the CWS page server-side (no CORS issues)
4. Proxy wraps the HTML in JSON and returns it with CORS headers
5. Extension parses the HTML to extract extension data

### Security

- **API key auth**: Prevents unauthorized use of your proxy
- **CORS restriction**: Only `chrome-extension://` origins and `localhost` can call the proxy
- **Rate limiting**: 30 req/min per API key (in-memory sliding window)
- **Caching**: 5-minute TTL reduces load on CWS and speeds up responses
- **Input validation**: Extension IDs must be exactly 32 lowercase letters

### Caching

Successful responses are cached for 5 minutes using Cloudflare's Cache API. The `X-Cache` header indicates cache status:
- `X-Cache: HIT` - Served from cache
- `X-Cache: MISS` - Fresh fetch from CWS

---

## Cloudflare Dashboard Management

After deployment, you can manage the Worker at:

```
https://dash.cloudflare.com > Workers & Pages > cws-tracker-proxy
```

From the dashboard you can:
- View request analytics (requests/day, errors, latency)
- View real-time logs (Logs tab > Begin log stream)
- Update environment variables and secrets (Settings > Variables)
- Set up custom domains (Settings > Triggers > Custom Domains)
- Configure additional rate limiting rules (Security > WAF)

### Custom Domain (Optional)

By default your Worker is at `cws-tracker-proxy.<subdomain>.workers.dev`. To use a custom domain:

1. Add a domain to Cloudflare (free plan works)
2. Go to Worker > Settings > Triggers > Custom Domains
3. Add your domain (e.g., `api.cws-tracker.com`)

---

## Updating the Worker

After making code changes:

```bash
npm test           # Verify tests pass
npm run deploy     # Deploy updated code
```

The update is instant and zero-downtime.

---

## Cost

**Free tier covers all expected usage:**

| Limit | Free Tier | Expected Usage |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Requests/day | 100,000 | ~100-500 (10 extensions x 20 keywords x daily scan + retries) |
| CPU time/request | 10ms | ~2-5ms (simple fetch relay) |
| Workers | Unlimited | 1 |

You would need the paid plan ($5/month) only if you exceed 100K requests/day, which would require ~200 active users running full scans simultaneously.
